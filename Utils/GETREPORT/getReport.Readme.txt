SYNOPSIS
getReport.pl will generate a summary report file, named report.txt, from the FAST output.  

OUTPUT
The output of getReport.pl is a list of genes that reach the significance threshold specified in the command line parameters.  A gene will be reported if it has significant p value from at least one of the FAST methods.  This list is followed by a list of significant SNPs in the non-transcribed regions.  getReport.pl reports all available results from the FAST output files.

USAGE
getReport.pl takes 4 parameters. 
./getReport.pl <file name> <model> <p value cut off for gene> < p value cut off for SNP>
<file name>:  the prefix of the FAST output files (The default output is FAST.result).  
<model>: The model used in FAST, either "Linear" or "Logistic".
<p value cut off for gene>: p value cut off for gene-based tests.  If permutation is not performed, this will be the percentage of 'significant' genes, ranked by the test statistics.
<p value cut off for SNP>: p value cut off for SNP-based tests.  If permutation is not performed, this will be the percentage of 'significant' genes, ranked by the test statistics.

EXAMPLE

The following example takes the FAST default output files using the linear model, and reports genes that have gene-based p value < 0.01 and SNP-based p value < 0.001.

Examples : 
./getReport.pl ../../Example/OUT/output Linear 0.01 0.001
./getReport.pl ../../Example/OUT/output Logistic 0.01 0.001
./getReport.pl ../../Example/OUT/output Summary 0.01 0.001
